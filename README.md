> Image Automater is a command-line tool that allows you to start a slideshow of images in a folder. You can customize the interval between images, background color, and other options.

## Install

### From source

1. Install Go on your system. You can download it from the [Official Go Website](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Clone the repository
3. Navigate to the repository folder
4. Run the following command to build the binary
```sh
go build -o ./bin/image_automater ./main.go
```

### Pre-built binaries
Pre-built binaries are available for Windows and Linux. You can download them from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/richbai90/image_automater/releases/latest)

## Usage

```sh
image_automater /path/to/folder [flags]
```

The command accepts the following flags:

* -i, --interval: Interval between images in milliseconds (default 1000)
* -b, --background: Background color (default "black")
* -t, --trigger-mode: Enable trigger mode
* -d, --Device: Device to use for trigger mode
* --Baud: Baud rate for trigger mode (default 9600)
* -r, --recursive: Enable recursive search for images

### Modes

The program has two modes: interval and trigger mode. In interval mode, the program will display images at a specified interval. In trigger mode, the program will wait for a trigger signal from a serial device before displaying the next image. This is useful for displaying images in a slideshow when you want to control when the next image is displayed. The exxpected trigger signal is "next". Once the next image is displayed, the program will send a "capture" message over serial and will wait for another trigger signal.

This mode is specifically designed for synchronizing the display of images with a camera. The camera will send a trigger signal over serial when it captures an image. The program will then display the next image in the slideshow. This allows you to display images in a slideshow that are captured by a camera. Without needing to synchronize the camera and computer clocks.
